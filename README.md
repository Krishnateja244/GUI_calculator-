## Project Title 
Uncertain <T> : A First-Order Type for Uncertain Data

## Objective 

This project aims to implement the concepts discussed in the paper `Uncertain <T> : A First-Order Type for Uncertain Data` [1]. The paper discusses developing a generic data structure that enables to measure, and analyze with taking into consideration uncertainty aspects. This data structure enables non-statisticians developers to use use statistics easily in different applications. 

## Programming Languages 

- Python
- C++
