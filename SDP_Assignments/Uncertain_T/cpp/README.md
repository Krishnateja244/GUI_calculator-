# Uncertain< T > in C++ 

This is an implementation of the datatype Uncertain< T > as discussed in [1]. This data structure is developed in C++ language. 

## General Idea 

The idea is to create a datatype which implements first order uncertainty. On an abstract level, it is desired to include uncertainty in calculations easily espicially for those who are not experts in uncertainty and statistics. 

## How does work? (to be updated frequently till the end of the project)
